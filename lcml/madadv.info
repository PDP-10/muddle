Welcome to Dungeon!

    You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
quantities of treasure.  Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon; to
receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
case in the living room. 
    
    In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich; you may
need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
material is scattered around the dungeon as well; some of it is 
rumoured to be useful.

    To determine how successful you have been, there is a score kept.
When you find a valuable object (i.e., pick it up), you receive a
certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
it.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure safely to
the living room, and placing it in the trophy case.  In addition,
some particularly interesting rooms  have a value associated with
your entering them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
which you may do only twice.

    Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
light of day).  He likes to take things; since he steals for pleasure
rather than profit, and is sadistic, he only takes things which you
have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste he
may take something which is worthless; from time to time, he examines
his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may
occasionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just
wanders through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).

    Have Fun!
