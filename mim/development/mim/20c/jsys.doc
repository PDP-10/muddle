<CALL SYSOP jsys arg1 arg2 ....>

arg1...argn become acs 1...n.  Unless it is a list of the form
(RETURN x) where x is  register number to return or ALL to BLT
them into a UVECTOR called AC-VECTOR.

SIN,SOUT,GTJFN are hacked specially.

All JSYSs have ERJMP hack that return #FALSE (error-code) on failure.
