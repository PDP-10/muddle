Dear Xxxx,
	Here is a list of the files that constitute the source for MUDDLE.
I don't know if you want all of them (total approximately 156000 36-bit
words of text--almost 1 million characters).  Please let me know which
you like FTPd to your machine.  MIDAS is very poorly documented, although
it is similar enough to other PDP-10 assmeblers that the code should
be readable by your system programmers.
